My research investigates how the brain represents information, focusing on the geometric structure of neural population codes. I explore how this geometry allows the early visual cortex (V1 and V2) to form stable, "cue-invariant" representations of visual concepts, regardless of how they are depicted (e.g., as line drawings or natural patches). My work also examines how the primate superior colliculus (SC) dynamically and "strategically reshapes" its neural geometry—an "attentional axis"—to flexibly adapt to changing and predictable task demands.
