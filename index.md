I am a researcher with a background in electrical engineering and a current focus on computational neuroscience. I am working at the University of Pittsburgh under Dr. James P. Herman.

My research involves applying computational methods to understand how neural populations in the primate brain represent information. I investigate the underlying geometric structure of these neural codes, aiming to understand how concepts are represented across different contexts and brain regions.

Outside of research, I enjoy cooking a lot. You can see a gallery of my cooking [here](/cooking/).
