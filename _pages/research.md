## Strategic reshaping of the attentional axis in superior primate colliculus
**Affiliation:** University of Pittsburgh (Supervisor: Dr. James P. Herman)

We investigated how the representational geometry of attention in the superior colliculus (SC) adapts to the predictability of task demands. We recorded from SC populations while monkeys performed an attention task with predictable (blocked) or unpredictable (interleaved) change types (subtle color vs. supra-threshold contrast). We found that in predictable blocks, the SC's preparatory activity revealed change-type-specific states not seen in unpredictable sessions. Crucially, geometric analysis showed this was not a simple gain modulation but a fundamental geometric reconfiguration, where the "attentional axis" for one change type was sometimes orthogonal or inverted relative to the other.

## Cue-invariant geometric structure of the population codes in macaque V1 and V2
**Affiliation:** Carnegie Mellon University (Supervisor: Dr. Tai-Sing Lee)

We investigated how macaque V1 and V2 represent visual boundaries across different cues (e.g., line drawings vs. natural images). We found that while single neurons have weak invariance, the *geometric structure* of the population code is highly stable. We developed a 'cue-transfer' decoding method using Procrustes analysis to show that these neural geometries can be aligned, revealing a robust, cue-invariant representation.

## Characteristics of underwater lighting based on white LEDs
**Affiliation:** Fudan University (Supervisor: Dr. Pengfei Tian)

This work systematically analyzed the characteristics of white LEDs for underwater lighting. We investigated how light properties, such as spectrum and color rendering, are affected by different water types and transmission distances. The findings provide a quantitative guide for the design and application of robust, high-quality LED-based lighting systems in underwater environments.
