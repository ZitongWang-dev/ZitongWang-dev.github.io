## Population coding in primate superior colliculus
**Affiliation:** University of Pittsburgh (Supervisor: Dr. James P. Herman)

Developed an "encoding subspace" framework using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to identify and compare how neural populations encode specific variables. Found that the superior colliculus exhibits distinct encoding patterns for target locations across different saccade tasks and for different stimulus change events (color vs. contrast) in an attention task.

## Population coding in primate early visual cortex
**Affiliation:** Carnegie Mellon University (Supervisor: Dr. Tai-Sing Lee)

Examined cue-invariant geometric structures in V1 and V2 population codes for representing surface boundaries across different visual cues. Developed a cue-transfer decoding approach using Procrustes analysis to align population codes and quantify cue invariance. This work demonstrated that cue-invariant structures are preserved across various conditions and improve with larger neural populations.

## GaN-based micro-LED and its applications
**Affiliation:** Fudan University (Supervisor: Dr. Pengfei Tian)

Designed experiments to simulate scattering particles in the ocean and measured underwater lighting effects using white LEDs. This work involved evaluating irradiation parameters based on distance and water particle concentration and calculating color rendering indices from measured spectra.
